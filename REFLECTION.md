## Were your predictions accurate?
Partially. Social activities did have very high enjoyment, but creative activities were equally enjoyable. Evening activities generally scored higher, which confirmed my prediction.

## What surprised you about your week?
I was surprised that short activities like yoga or talking with a friend produced almost the same enjoyment as longer activities. Time spent did not always equal happiness.

## Which higher-order function was most useful and why?
`filter()` was the most useful because it helped me quickly find patterns, such as activities with high enjoyment but low time investment. It made the data much easier to analyze.
